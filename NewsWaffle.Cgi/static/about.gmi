# About NewsWaffle

## What?

NewsWaffle is a Gemini gateway to public news websites, allowing you to get lists of current news articles, and read those news articles, all from inside Gemini.

Instead of only being able to read "text only" specific or "lite" versions of news sites, NewsWaffle works with nearly any news site.

## Why?
* Modern news sites are user hostile, full of popups, nag-walls, and intrustive ads.
* Modern news sites are BLOATED, wasting time and data. Even the HTML itself is bloated, hundreds of kilobytes in size when the actual article content is only 1-4 kilobytes.
* Modern news sites are slow. Who has time for that nonsense?

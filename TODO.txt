# Features
- Better organize links by using HTML5 tags to separate tags in content
from navigational/header/footer links

    - Maybe don't show links from those section by default, and make people click a "show more"

- Handle link pages that don't have og:type=website (daring fireball, Irish times, etc)

- options to change Article rendering?
    - include links in articles?

- More OG metadata for Links view
    - Description of site
    - Last Modified? from HTTP header?
    - Image of site

- More OG metadata for article view
    - Excerpt?
    - Number of words?
    - Reading time?
    - by line/author


- "Gemipedia"-ify the article view some more
    - have an image gallery?
    - add a proxy for images?

- better tracking of how much savings there is
    - create a wrapper on the CGI stream that tracks how many bytes have been written?
    - show a percentage smaller (smoler)

- Don't have seperate "portal" and "article" routes. Just a single route that changes its rendering bsed on the page

- Add a caching layer
    - for the articles?
    need to use a short TTL
